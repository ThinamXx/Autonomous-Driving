# **Autonomous Driving with YOLO**

**YOLO**
- "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.

**Note:**
- The Notebook included in this repository is taken from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The main reason I have included this Notebook in my repositoy is that I found this Project really interesting. You can gain insights about the Implementation of YOLO algorithm from scratch. I myself was very excited to do this Project as a part of Assignment in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). Hope you will enjoy too and gain some useful insights.
